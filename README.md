UniCore is the ultimate Minecraft mod and library,
adding many new APIs and ways to engineer your own
mod to be great.

This repository only holds the UniCore modding API.
The API and implementations are split as to make it
more easily understandable which classes are available
publically within the API. If you'd like to learn more
about the UniCore modding API, [click here][docs].

You can find more information on the UniCore mod and library
on [our website][website] and in [our Discord server][discord].
