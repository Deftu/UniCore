UniCore is the ultimate Minecraft mod and library,
adding many new APIs and ways to engineer your own
mod to be great.

This repository only holds the UniCore modding API,
the implementations are closed-source to protect
users' privacy and keep the security of the mod to
a good standard. We can assure that there is no mal-intent
going on under the hood, and we promise to keep you and
your information safe! To read more about the security
of UnifyCraft products and services, please refer

You can find more information on the UniCore mod and library
on [our website][website] and in [our Discord server][discord].
